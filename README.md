# **App for managing your plans or projects**

- **Local** for your needs
- Your plans/projects are **dragable!**
- Requires **server** (could be local)

---

# **How to run code?**

> ## **FIRST STEP**
>
> ### **Open your Visual Studio Code or default console (easier to use VSCode).**
>
> - **IF you use VSCode**, just type in your terminal (to find it => _Ctrl + '_ ) and type there `npm i` or `npm install`
>
> - **IF you use cmd etc.**, you need to navigate your console to the project:
>   1. For that use command `dir` to look through which directories you have available
>   2. Next you need to choose your directory `cd` and place where your project is located (e.g. `cd desktop`). If it is located deeper than just on _desktop_, use `cd` multiple times and that's it
>   3. Type in your console (that's navigated to your project) `npm i` or `npm install`

> ## Via node.js
>
> 1. [Go to nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
>
> 2. download the latest version available for your system
>
> 3. Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code
>
> 4. Type there: `npm install -g serve`
>    > **!** _You may need to type "sudo" on mac or linux in front of the prompt_ **!**
> 5. When downloaded, open this project and type in terminal: `serve`
> 6. Open provided link in your browser and thats it!
>    - eg ( - Local:http://localhost:3000 )

---

> ## Using Live Server extension
>
> 1. Open your Visual Studio Code
>
> 2. Find the Extensions tab ( Ctrl + Shift + X )
>
> 3. Search: Live Server ( or: "ritwickdey.LiveServer" )
>
>    ![You should see this](assets/photos/readme/LiveServer.png)
>
> 4. Install it
>
> 5. Open this project, right click on **index.html** file and choose **Open with Live Server**.  
>    Should be **_Alt +L Alt + O_** by default
>
> 6. OR click on the **Go Live** button in your status bar. In case you don't see any _Go Live_ button, double click in any place of status bar, select the _Live Server (Extension)_ and you'll see this button!
